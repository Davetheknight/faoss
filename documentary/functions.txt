Functions are found in (your project's root directory)/headers. There you will find files like puts.h.

Note that I am using quotation marks to reference to the header file locations. This is how you are 
meant to reference these files from any c program, since I set the project's root to the makefile's
pwd output.

Always check this file before making functions to make sure that your function's name hasn't been
taken!!!

By the way, all header functions are being described by the header files' alphabetical order. 
Simply doing "ls" in your terminal will show all the header files from a to z. This is the order 
that I've chosen to make it.

All type declarations are in types.h.

Here are all of the functions, locations, and usage:

	In "gets.h": string readStr(), uint8 strEql(string ch1, string ch2) 

	In "init.h": uint8 inportb(uint16 _port), void outportb(uint16 _port, uint8 _data), uint16 strlength(string ch) 

#	In "printf.h": No functions.

	In "puts.h": void puts(string ch, int colour), void printch(char c)

	In "sfuncts.h": void clearLine(uint8 from,uint8 to), void clearScreen(), void updateCursor(). 

#	In "stdarg.h": No functions useful to project (its a "hello world").
