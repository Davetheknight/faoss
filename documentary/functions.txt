Functions are found in (your project's root directory)/headers. There you will find files like puts.h.

Note that I am using quotation marks to reference to the header file locations. This is how you are 
meant to reference these files from any c program, since I set the project's root to the makefile's
pwd output.

Always check this file before making functions to make sure that your function's name hasn't been
taken!!!

By the way, all header functions are being described by the header files' alphabetical order. 
Simply doing "ls" in your terminal will show all the header files from a to b. This is the order 
that I've chosen to make it.

All type declarations are in types.h.

Here are all of the functions, locations, and usage:

#	In "gets.h": No functions.

	In "init.h": uint8<equivalent to 'unsigned char'> inportb(uint16<equivalent to 'unsigned short'> _port), and void outportb(uint16<equivalent to 'unsigned short'> _port, uint8<equivalent to 'unsigned char'> _data) 

#	In "printf.h": No functions.

	In "puts.h": void puts(const char *string, int colour)

	In "sfuncts.h": void clearLine(uint8<equivalent to 'unsigned char'> from,uint8<equivalent to 'unsigned char'> to), void clearScreen(), and void updateCursor(). 

#	In "stdarg.h": No functions useful to project (its a "hello world").
